# 🚀 Introducing MCP Utility Tools

I'm excited to announce the release of **MCP Utility Tools** - a collection of essential utilities for the Model Context Protocol that makes building robust AI workflows easier!

## 🎯 What is it?

MCP Utility Tools provides common patterns that every MCP integration needs:
- 🔄 **Retry with exponential backoff** - Handle flaky APIs gracefully
- 💾 **TTL-based caching** - Reduce API calls and improve performance  
- 🚀 **Batch operations** - Process multiple items efficiently
- 🚦 **Rate limiting** - Respect API limits automatically

## 💡 Why I built this

While working with Claude and various MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, Sentry), I found myself repeatedly needing these patterns. Instead of reimplementing them in each project, I created this reusable toolkit.

## 🔧 Quick Example

```bash
# Install
npm install -g mcp-utility-tools

# Add to Claude Desktop
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "utility-tools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-utility-tools"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now Claude can:
- Cache expensive API calls
- Retry failed operations automatically
- Process items in batches with concurrency control
- Respect rate limits across all integrations

## 🌟 Features

- **Full TypeScript support** with type definitions
- **MCP Inspector compatible** for easy debugging
- **Memory-efficient** with automatic cleanup
- **Battle-tested** with comprehensive test suite
- **Zero dependencies** beyond MCP SDK

## 📦 Get Started

- **npm**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-utility-tools
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/haasonsaas/mcp-utility-tools
- **Documentation**: Full examples and integration guides included

## 🤝 Contributing

This is just v1.0.0! I'd love your help adding:
- Redis/SQLite storage backends
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Request deduplication
- Performance metrics

## 🙏 Thanks

Built on top of Anthropic's excellent Model Context Protocol. Special thanks to the MCP community for inspiration and feedback.
